        "description": "Japan is home to a lot of interesting things, from sushi to cherry blossom trees and unique-looking birds. It is a must-visit destination, at least once in a lifetime, as it is vibrant with tradition and interesting places. If you happen to plan a visit to Japan, Hokkaido island should be on your list thanks to its volcanic rocks and not only. Besides the beautiful scenery, the island is also home to a tiny bird species that look like flying cotton-candy balls. This specific type of bird, called Shima-enaga can only be found in this region of Japan and they are long-tailed tit birds with tiny black eyes. At first glance, these birds look like tiny toys and other closely relates species can be found in various places of Europe and Asia, but the white and fluffy ones are specific to this area. Hokkaido island is well-known for its national parks and its high number of bird populations, but the park is rich in other wildlife too and all the animals living there are accustomed to tourists.See more at: https: //goodshomedesign.com/tiny-birds-that-look-like-flying-cotton-balls-live-on-japanese-island/"

        "description": "The crane is one of the many emblems of longevity and wisdom, and is often depicted in paintings alongside pine trees, deer, or stones to represent eternal youth. One Chinese fable says that once the crane reaches 600 years old it no longer needs to eat, and in art and literature immortals are often shown riding red-crowned cranes. When shown near bamboo cranes are an emblem of nobleness or purity. And as they are monogamous and stay with one partner until death, they are said to symbolise loyalty and long-lasting love in marriage."

        "description": "The origin of the Bolognese is confused with that of the Maltese, because their distant ancestors are the same little dogs mentioned in Latin by Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) under the denomination of canes melitenses. Bolognese, already known in the Roman era, appears most especially among the very appreciated gifts, which were made during a whole era by the people of power of that world. Cosimo de Medici (1389–1464) brought no less than eight to Brussels as gifts to as many Belgian noblemen. Philipe II, King of Spain 1556–1598, after having received two as a gift from the Duke d’Este, thanked him in writing saying, ”These little dogs are the most royal gifts one can give to an emperor”. Bolognese are represented in paintings by Titian, Pierre Breughel called le Vieux and Goya. "

Science Daily reported that the beloved, wrinkly Shar Pei breed was almost lost in this time period. Fortunately the country's special breeds have flourished in the years since. It's now common to find them as pets in both China and across the world. Many of the dogs we've grown up seeing in dog parks, on social media, and even in our own homes are breeds that stem from the Chinese. These 11 popular dog breeds all have roots in China."
